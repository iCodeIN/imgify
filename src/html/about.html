    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Hey! You're using an instance of <a
            href="https://github.com/randomairborne/imgify">imgify</a>. My hosted
        version of this is available at <a href="https://img.mcping.me">https://img.mcping.me</a>. It's backed by
        CloudFlare R2, using an open-source CloudFlare Worker. I host it for free, for everyone, just don't do anything
        illegal.
        <br>
        Love, <a href="https://randomairborne.dev">valk</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Why do you have an upload limit?</h3>
    <p>
        CloudFlare charges for certain amounts of data. My upload limit is higher then most others, but it comes at the
        cost of deleting faster.
    </p>
    <h3>Do you sell or give out my data?</h3>
    <p>
        No.
    </p>
    <h3>Then how do you make money?</h3>
    <p>
        I don't. I provide this service for free, out of my own pocket. If you'd like to support me, see
        <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/randomairborne">my GitHub Sponsors page</a>. Thanks!
